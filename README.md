Some Issues:
-Issue:Picture 25 is kind of buggy in this version for some reason
[Reason: Needs Investigation; Fix: ""]
-Draw is really a skeleton function is kind of buggy in this version for some reason
[Reason:

- The visualisation is a 3-D sphere but it is not clear from visualisation that this can be inferred;
Fix:
- Few more days of tinkering with matplotlib]
